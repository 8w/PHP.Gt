The API system
--------------

The API is a layer on top of the DAL, intended to:

1. Abstract the database, allowing for advanced data manipulation if necessary.
2. Create a single point of access to the data via code *and* webservices.
3. Allow non-standard or external data sources to be accessed easily.
