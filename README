streamlining development and respecting web technologies

Latest release: v0.0.1 (Alpha)

Versions
--------

Version numbers are given in the following format:
vRelease.Beta.Alpha

So the first public release is
v1.0.0

The first ever public beta (before v1 release) is
v0.1.0

**Alpha versions** are a collection of minor related code changes. Their
progress can be quantified, and a version increments when the whole
collection is completed.

Between alpha versions, any point of the codebase can become unstable.

**Beta versions** are collections of alpha releases that create a
substational change to the functionality, or fix major problems with the
codebase.

Between beta versions, only pre-defined areas of the codebase can become
unstable, and no beta release should break functionality out of this area.

**Public versions** are finalised, finished and fully tested collections of
beta updates. Public versions can only increment when there are **no known
bugs** - future releases should not be fixes of public versions, but new
features or improvements.
