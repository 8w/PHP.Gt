Style
=====
Very much like the way the Script directory is handled, the Style directory contains a shared collection of CSS files and fonts. Included as standard are the GtReset.css which provides a consistent starting point across all browsers, and GtUi.css which is a complementary style sheet for the GtUi JavaScript file.

Style sheets are minified together at runtime, just like JavaScript is.
