The Class directory
===================

All classes in this directory can be autoloaded at any time by PHP.Gt.

The point in the classes here are to provide object-oriented enhancements to PHP. Certain areas of PHP can be enhanced by wrapping in objects, and new features can be introduced.

Note: Classes here are meant to be single-purpose utilities, and not multi-purpose tools. Classes do not have access to the current page, the database, or any other scripts within PHP.Gt. If a class becomes more of a tool than a simple utility, it can be promoted to a PageTool.
